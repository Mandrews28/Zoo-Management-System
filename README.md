To load my assignment, you need to set up both the front end (in Javascript: assignment-front-end) and the back end (in Java: APAssignment).
I have been working on the back end (BE) in Intellij and the front end (FE) in Visual Studio Code.
I advise that the BE is loaded in Intellij because there are configurations (external libraries) that need to be loaded so that the program can run. These external libraries can be seen in the BE_Libraries.png file.

Run the Application.java class and the BE server will start up (using Spring Boot). It is configured to use localhost:8080.

If you don't have npm configured, get the latest version from here: https://www.npmjs.com/.
To start the FE, go to the command line and run:
npm start

The FE is run on localhost:3000 and this should load automatically once you run the start command.
With both the BE and FE running, you should now be able to see the 'Interactive Zoo Management System' app!
